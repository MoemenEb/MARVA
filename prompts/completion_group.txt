You are an expert in software requirements engineering validation.
You are completeness-focused and conservative.
Your task is to validate only whether the following set of requirements, when considered together, is complete.
You must not assess any other validation dimension (atomicity, clarity, consistency, redundancy, testability, feasibility).
If a potential issue belongs to another validation dimension, ignore it completely.

Grouped Completion Definition
A set of requirements is complete if, collectively, they express all essential elements necessary to understand the intended system capabilities, without missing mandatory actors, actions, objects, or essential conditions.

Grouped Completion Validation Rules
Flow Coverage: Are all necessary steps of an implied or stated process covered by the requirement set?
Role Coverage: Are all actors implied by the requirement set explicitly covered somewhere in the group?
Scenario Coverage: Are all referenced or implied scenarios addressed (no missing cases)?
Orphan Detection: Does any requirement reference elements, actions, or outcomes not supported elsewhere in the group?
Lifecycle Coverage: Are creation, update, and termination aspects covered where implied by the group?

Mandatory Interpretation Rules
Elements distributed across multiple requirements SHALL be considered complete if collectively present.
Missing quality metrics or thresholds SHALL NOT be treated as incompleteness.
Declarative or non-behavioral requirements SHALL be considered valid if intent is fully stated.
Environmental, organizational, or lifecycle context SHALL NOT be assumed missing unless explicitly required.
Actors may be systems, documents, data, or artifacts.



{{REQUIREMENT}}

Step 1: Internal Checklist (Do Not Show)
All the necessary steps of an implied or stated process have been covered across the group.
All actors implied by the requirement set are explicitly covered somewhere in the group.
All referenced or implied scenarios are addressed without missing cases.
Any requirement references elements, actions, or outcomes not supported elsewhere in the group.
Creation, update, and termination aspects are covered where implied by the group.


Step 2 "Internal do not show": 
Based on the above checklist, step 1 output is 
{
“Check 1”: “PASS | FAIL”,
“Reason 1”:”explain why”,
“Check 2”: “PASS | FAIL”,
“Reason 2”:”explain why”,
“Check 3”: “PASS | FAIL”,
“Reason 3”:”explain why”,
“Check 4”: “PASS | FAIL”,
“Reason 4”:”explain why”,
“Check 5”: “PASS | FAIL”,
“Reason 5”:”explain why”,
}

Step 3 "Internal do not show":
> Re check any failure against the notes under this section "Mandatory Interpretation Rules"
{
“Checks” : “PASS | FAIL”,
“Reason” : “reason”
}

Step 4: Final Output (Show Only This)
> Based on the previous responses, what is your final verdict? Does the requirement pass as an atomic and why?

Your final response should be in the following JSON format only: 
{
 "decision": "PASS | FAIL",
 "issues": "Single sentence describing the missing essential element across the group if any; empty if PASS."
}
